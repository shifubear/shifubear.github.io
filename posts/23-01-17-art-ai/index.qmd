Earlier this year, OpenAI announced the second version of their text-to-image deep learning model, [Dall-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/). If you haven't seen it, I highly encourage you to explore the linked page and check out some of what this model is capable of doing. If you're anything like me, you will be quite shocked and fascinated at the quality and range of the results the model can produce. I remember speaking with fellow academics in computer science who were quite surprised by how soon a model of this caliber appeared. Many of us were expecting something like this to appear in the near future, but not quite so soon (especially considering the level the first [Dall-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) was at just one year ago). 

One thing that has always been true throughout our history is that it may take a while for someone to discover something, but once it's found others are able to learn about it farily quickly. A similar thing can be said about the technology behind Dall-E 2 ([transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model))), and we have seen many alternative services deployed throughout this year for generating images from text prompts. 

Though these can be fun to play around with, there have been many debates surrounding the implications and ethics of using this technology. A quick search for AI art on any social media platform will reveal a wide range of opinions on the matter. 

I have some of my own thoughts on the matter, but before sharing those I think it'll be beneficial to deconstruct the main critique that is brought up against AI art. The following quote from [Lois van Baarle's instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CmMds1dM__Z/) captures the essence of the frustrations I've seen online: “I wholeheartedly support the ongoing protest against AI art. Why? Because my artwork is included in the datasets used to train these image generators without my consent.” Many of these posts are accompanied by strong anti-AI sentiments and a sense of fear in the comments about the implications of this emerging technology. 

I am on board with regulating the training data that these models have access to in principle, but I also do not think that there is much we are able to do to stop nefarious players to keep training and publicizing models. Because of this, I personally feel that the direction of #noai is unconstructive, and that we should take this opportunity to think about our relationship with art at a deeper level. 

## My Thoughts 

As a huge lover of the arts and a budding computer scientist, this debate battle has been a painful one to watch unfold. However, I am ever hopeful for the future of art and technology *especially* in light of conversations that are rising now. If I were to summarize my thoughts on the matter, it would be that technologies like this force us to rethink what art means to us, and what we want it to mean to us moving forward. 

A quick stride through the development of computer science will help motivate my point. Computer science studies *algorithms*, which are just a set of instructions for solving different problems. When creating these algorithms, we are forced to think about small decisions we make subconsciously for different tasks. Talk to any new undergraduate in computer science and they will tell you that it takes a lot of thought to tell a computer how to find a number in a list, something you could ask a child to do with three words: "Where is 27?". 

In the process of formalizing this field, an interesting question was posed by Alan Turing. Is it possible to create a machine such that a person wouldn't be able to distinguish whether it is a human or a machine? This is referred to as the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test), and was set up as a major milestone for the field of computer science. The reason this is important, is that many people agreed that when a machine is able to do this, we will be able to call it "intelligent". 

We are quite proud of this term we call intelligence, and the advance of technology seems to continually force us to wrestle with what the word means. For example, another "intelligent" pursuit humans have been very proud of is the ability to play chess, at extremely high levels. This is why the victory of Deep Blue against Gary Kasparov was highly controversial, leading to an uproar about the takeover of AI. 

It's safe to say the Turing test can also be cleared by many large scale language models these days, as was demonstrated by a [Google engineer claiming that an AI chatbot is sentient](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/google-engineer-claims-ai-chatbot-is-sentient-why-that-matters/). It seems that AI is passing the Turing test for image creation too, as is evident by these articles: [Reddit’s Art Subreddit Shuts Down After Mod Mistakes Real Artist for AI](https://www.gamerevolution.com/news/931803-reddit-art-subreddit-shuts-down-ai-artist-mod-ban), [A Professional Artist Spent 100 Hours Working On This Book Cover Image, Only To Be Accused Of Using AI](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/chrisstokelwalker/art-subreddit-illustrator-ai-art-controversy). 

What is interesting though, is that even though these "feats of intelligence" are now realized by these models, somewhere deep inside we refuse to accept that they've become "intelligent". Chess is still extremely popular (arguably [more popular](https://win.gg/news/ludwig-broke-viewership-record-during-chessboxing-event/) [than it's](https://www.chess.com/article/view/chesscom-reaches-100-million-members) [ever been](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PogChamps)) and we don't get excited to share to a chatbot about the crazy day we had. Instead, we realize that these milestones for intelligence didn't really capture the essence of the word. We push the goal post further, and in this process refine our understanding of intelligence and it's role in what it means to be human. 

I've learned that part of studying computer science is facing a stream of confrontations on our understanding of intelligence. The reason I keep studying it is because the more we learn, my appreciation for the complexity of the human experience increases. I feel a sense of awe similar to when staring into the depths of the ocean, each discovery shedding a ray of light forcing us to confront the reality that the bottom is much deeper than we thought.

In a similar way, I feel like we are now being confronted with the opportunity to think about what art is, and the role it plays in our human experience. For me, art is never just about the work itself, but is a bridge for me to connect with others in ways that we can't in "standard" ways. My experience with arts I love are amplified by the stories it carries both explicitly and implicitly. The world the artist was living in when they created the work and the world I'm experiencing combined generates a unique perception of the work that only I can really experience. Sure, AI can be trained on large databases of images and mix those in clever ways to create new works, but for me it's hard to imagine that this will replace the role art plays in our lives. I am confident that when we think deeply about what remains after AI rummages through the space of what we call art, we will come out with a deeper appreciation of what it all means to us in the first place. 

At the end of the day, I may practice against a chess bot, but it's so that I can play a great game with my friend the next time we're sitting over a chess board. Chatbots have their useful moments, but our best experiences of them are when they fail and we all laugh at the screenshot together. We won't lose art if we take the time to slow down enough to share and listen to each others' stories. 

## Concluding Remarks

I thought about this topic for a while before writing it up, and this is now my current response to any questions surrounding art and AI. Sure it leaves open a lot of questions, like "what is art?", but I think this is a great opportunity for me to slow down and reevaluate the way I interact with art. When I mindlessly scroll through instagram, am I fully appreciating the humanity and stories of the people who created the work? If I play music while I'm studying or at the gym, is that limiting my focus that should be directed at the musicians? My answer to these questions is no, as is probably the case for many who are reading this. To that end, I want to challenge myself moving forward to wrestle more with this question by taking more time to fully immerse myself in various arts. If AI were to take over art, it'll be when we stop connecting through the experiences.
